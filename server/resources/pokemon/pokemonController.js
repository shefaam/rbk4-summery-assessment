// i am trying to find a way to make the required functions ,, but not by build in functions ,,
// like 'i ve read about it ': insert (one || many) , remove () , update (one || many) 
//bcs. we have already build in function that can create , retreive (One or Many) , update , delete (One or Many) ;
